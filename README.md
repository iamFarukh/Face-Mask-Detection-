# FACE MASK DETECTION

In this project, we have developed a **deep learning** model for face mask detection using **Python, Keras, and OpenCV**. We developed the face mask detector model for detecting whether person is wearing a mask or not. We have trained the model using Keras with network architecture. Training the model is the first part of this project and testing using webcam using OpenCV is the second part.


# Motivation

**Coronavirus disease 2019** has affected the world seriously. According to **WHO**, One major protection method for people is to wear masks in public areas. In this, we will use **Deep Learning** to accurately identify that a person **wearing a mask or not** from a **Live Webcam.**

# Tools and Technologies

**Language** : Python
**Machine learning** : OpenCV, Numpy, sklearn, matplot etc.
**Deep learning** : Natural Language Processing,  Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
**Model** : Caffe Model, Cascade Model
**Deep Learning frameworks** : TensorFlow, Caffe, and PyTorch.
**Tools** : Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebook, Command Prompt,  Git Bash, PyCharm

## Working

 1. First we **train** our **machine** with **data set** 
 2. then it create a **Deep learning Model**
 3. **This Model** will help to accurately identify that a person **wearing a mask or not** from a **Live Webcam.**
